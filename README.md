# Bayesian-Analysis
Statistical analysis tasks in Bayesian framework using R and Stan.

**NOTE:** Users should firstly setup the Bayesian environment by using the `.R` file. In order to obtain the `.rds` files, users should
compile the `Stan` chunks in `.rmd` files and save the outputs.

Code inside the two `.R` files is directly adapted from Dr. Eric Reyes's MA483 class resources.
